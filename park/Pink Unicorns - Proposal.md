## Project Description ##



### Services Provided ###

Students will be able to locate nearby parking lots. The application will try and find the best suitable parking lot and parking space from their available location.  

### Programming Implementation ###

A wiring sensor will be connected to a parking spot. The sensor will detect whether or not a car is present. The information from the sensor will be sent to a database. The database will be accessed through an app, and the app will display the data to the end user.

### Systems Customers ###

Our targets will mainly be students, staff, and other university personnel.

### Idealization - Reserved for future contribution ideas
